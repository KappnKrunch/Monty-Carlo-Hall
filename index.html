    <p>The Monty Hall Problem is a well known statistical thought experiemnt made popular by the game show 'let's make a deal' and it's host Monty Hall. The problem states that there are three doors. Behind one there is a prize and behind the other two there is nothing of interest. You are first given a choice of the the three doors. After selecting one, Monty reveals a door you haven't selected and shows you it doesn't have the prize. You are then given the choice to choose the remaining door or stay with the one you picked. <br>  <br/> 
        Which is the better option and what is the probability?</p>
    <p>We can assume that we will have the same prbability regardless of which door we choose initially. For this reason we will say that we have choosen door #1. We label the case where the car actually is behind door n as Hn, and call D the case where monty opens door #3 and offers a switch to door #2.</p>
    <div id="knowns1"></div>
    <div id="knowns2"></div>
    <p>Some of these values might seem arbitrary but they become more concise as you consider their origin. P(D) = 1/2 because after choosing one door, there are two left. Similarily,
      each of the liklihoods comes from the fact that Monty wants to open a door that is neither the prize nor one you selected.</p>
    <div id="unknowns"></div>
    <p>We're looking for the liklihood that the car is behind door #n given that we selected the first door, monty opened door #3, and we were offered a switch to door #2.</p>
    <div id="bayes-identities"></div>
    <br><div id="bayes-values"></div><br>
    <div id="bayes-conclusion"></div>
    <br>These are the likelihoods of the prize being behind each of the doors. You can see, in each case, the option to switch produces a higher chance of picking the prize.
      While this may seem counterintuitive as first, the reslts become more apparent when you consider that you're in fact playing a much simpler game when you choose to stay.
      These results apply regardless of which door we choose initially i.e, it's always better to switch. In fact it's twice as likely to produce a win.
    <br>This is a simulation showing the reslts of staying or switching, and the analytical values we came up with through bayes theorem.<br><br>
